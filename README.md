# Horiseon Accessibility Challenge

In this challenge, a prewritten website was provided by the client *Horiseon*. It lacked accessibility standards and the code did not follow best practices.<br>

No visual changes were made to the page; all were made behind the scenes, as outlined in the clients ask.<br>
<br>

## 🏗️ List of most important changes made
- IMG tags were given alt's, when necessary, to assist with screen readers and other accessibility features.
- All div's were changed to semantic elements, allowing easy readability for developers, as well as screen readers.
- Repetitive elements in the CSS file were consolidated to single functions.
- After combining repetitive elements in CSS, unused classes in HTML were removed.
- Meaningful comments were added to assist with developer readability in both HTML and CSS files.
- All links and HREF's were inspected and changed, as necessary, to achieve the desired result.
